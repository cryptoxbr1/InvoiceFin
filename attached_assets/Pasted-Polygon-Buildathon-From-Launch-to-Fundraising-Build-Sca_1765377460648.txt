🏗️ 10 Waves, 5 Months, Dual-Phase Structure
Phase 1: Sprint to Funding (Wave 1–5, 2.5 months)
The first phase is your sprint to secure initial funding. Choose your theme and execute:

Foundation & Setup (Wave 1–2): Polygon integration, technical setup, product-market fit validation
Build & Optimize (Wave 3–4): Feature development, user acquisition, business model refinement
Pitch & Raise (Wave 5): Demo presentation, VC meetings, funding round execution Goal: Secure your first funding round within 2.5 months
Phase 2: Scale & Expand (Wave 6–10, 2.5 months)
Based on your Phase 1 results and funding success, we'll determine your Phase 2 strategy:

Continue your current theme with expanded scope and budget
Pivot to a new theme (AI, DeFi, or Infrastructure) with fresh opportunities
Scale across multiple themes with your proven track record
Your Phase 2 path, budget allocation, and timeline will be customized based on your Phase 1 performance and funding outcomes.

Each Wave is a 14-day build cycle focused on measurable business metrics and scaling milestones. Every submission gets feedback. Phase 1 success determines your Phase 2 opportunity.
